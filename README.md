## Get Caffienated!


![](java.png)

Caffiene is a tiny static site generator written in Java. All it does is take Markdown files and renders them to HTML. The HTML templates are stitched together using Mustache-Java and rendered in index.html, which GitPages picks up. 

The site itself is here: 
http://vickiboykis.com/caffeine

The blog posts are notes from my [Java OOP and algos course this semester](https://www.mc3.edu/courses/cis-111b-computer-science-ii-object-oriented-programming). That's it!
