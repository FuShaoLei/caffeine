<h2>title:  Time Complexity
date: 2022-09-01</h2>
<p>Each algorithm carries a cost in terms of performance over a given set of data
and a given datastructure. Time efficiency tells us how many times a given operation is
performed so we can compare it across various hardware/software permutations equally.</p>

<p>In order of increasing complexity:</p>
<p>| O(1)       |
|------------|
| O(log n)   |
| O(n)       |
| O(n log n) |
| O(n^2)     |
| O(2^n)     |
| O(n!)      |</p>
