<h2>title: Things I learned about Java so far
date: 2022-11-08</h2>
<p>Things I learned about Java so far: everything except for primitives is
an object and inherits from other objects up the Java hierarchy tree.
This makes it easy to create composable OOP flows.</p>
<h3>The Build story</h3>
<p>Building Java projects is very easy and extremely standard through
maven. You can also use gradle but I don't recommend it.</p>
