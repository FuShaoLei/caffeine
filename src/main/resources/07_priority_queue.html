<h2>title: Priority queue ADT
date: 2022-11-14</h2>
<p>Priority queue - abstract data type with highest-priority element can be accessed. As events are
generated, they are enqueued with a priority level equal to the tie the event takes place</p>
<p>Interface for a Priority queue:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">package ch09.priorityQueues;

public interface PriQueueInterface&lt;T&gt;
{
  void enqueue(T element); 
  // Throws PriQOverflowException if this priority queue is full;
  // otherwise, adds element to this priority queue.

  T dequeue();
  // Throws PriQUnderflowException if this priority queue is empty;
  // otherwise, removes element with highest priority from this 
  // priority queue and returns it.

  boolean isEmpty();
  // Returns true if this priority queue is empty; otherwise, returns false.

  boolean isFull();
  // Returns true if this priority queue is full; otherwise, returns false.
 
  int size();
  // Returns the number of elements in this priority queue.
}

</code></pre>
<p>Difference between queue and priority queue is how the deque operation implemented. Priority
queue does not allow FIFO, always highest-priority element. In our case, the largest element.</p>
<p>Implementations of priority queues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unsorted Arrays - enqueing is easy, dequeueing is hard</li>
<li>Sorted Arrays  - last element is largest in a sorted array, O(1) operation</li>
<li>Sorted Linked List - dequeuing is easiest because it's already sorted</li>
<li>Binary search tree - tree insert operation - largest element is the rightmost tree element
Works really well unless the tree is skewed</li>
</ol>
<p>Heap - imlementation of priority queue that uses binary tree that has two properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>full binary tree: all leaves on the same level and eery non-leaf node has two children</li>
<li>complete; full or full through the next-to-last level</li>
</ol>
<p>Shape: underlying tree must be a complete binary tree;
order: for every node in the tree, value stored in
that node is greater than or equal to the value of the children</p>
