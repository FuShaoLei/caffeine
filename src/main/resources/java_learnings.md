Things I learned about Java so far: everything except for primitives is
an object and inherits from other objects up the Java hierarchy tree. 
This makes it easy to create composable OOP flows. 

### The Build story

Building Java projects is very easy and extremely standard through
maven. You can also use gradle but I don't recommend it.
