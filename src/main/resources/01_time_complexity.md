Each algorithm carries a cost in terms of performance over a given set of data
and a given datastructure. Time efficiency tells us how many times a given operation is 
performed so we can compare it across various hardware/software permutations equally.

In order of increasing complexity: 

| O(1)       |
|------------|
| O(log n)   |
| O(n)       |
| O(n log n) |
| O(n^2)     |
| O(2^n)     |
| O(n!)      |
