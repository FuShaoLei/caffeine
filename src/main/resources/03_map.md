Maps are collections of key/value pairs. A `Map` is similar to a 
collection but doesn't inherit from `Collection` in Java. It also supports adition, removal, and 
finding of information. But the difference is that Map separates key from element inforation.

+ Hashing allows us to efficiently find keys in a `Map` with a cost of O(1). `get(key)` will return the value of a map. 

+ Keys must be unique but values don't have to be. 

Several ways to implement maps:
    + Unsorted arrays
    + Sorted arrays
    + Unsorted Linked Lists
