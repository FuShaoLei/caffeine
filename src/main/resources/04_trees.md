Trees are a variation on collections (which have add, remove, get, and contains operations)
that maintains elements in increasing order and provides
efficient implementations of all the core operations.

A binary search tree maintains elements in increasing order 
and provides efficient access to operations. 

Example:
```
         2               
        / \       
       /   \      
      /     \     
     /       \    
     7       5       
    / \     / \   
   /   \   /   \  
   2   6   3   6   
  / \ / \ / \ / \ 
  5 8 4 5 8 4 5 8 
```
