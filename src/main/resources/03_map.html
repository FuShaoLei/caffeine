<h2>title:  Map ADT
date: 2022-10-05</h2>
<p>Maps are collections of key/value pairs. A <code>Map</code> is similar to a
collection but doesn't inherit from <code>Collection</code> in Java. It also supports adition, removal, and
finding of information. But the difference is that Map separates key from element inforation.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hashing allows us to efficiently find keys in a <code>Map</code> with a cost of O(1). <code>get(key)</code> will return the value of a map.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keys must be unique but values don't have to be.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Several ways to implement maps:
+ Unsorted arrays
+ Sorted arrays
+ Unsorted Linked Lists</p>
